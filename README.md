Your hangman is a great work of art.  Now, seriously, I think that your hangman site has well designed buttons that fit the theme and idea of the game.  I appreciated the graphic of the x over the button to signify it's incorrect answer and use and the deactivated buttons for a proper answer and also deactivated for further use.
